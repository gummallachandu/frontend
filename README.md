After thorough debugging the code with Srini, we reviewed the CSV files and performed calculations for credits, totals, and securitized products across three stripes. 



Observed that the model misinterpreted column formats, using 'riskfactorname' instead of 'riskfactorsystemname,' and incorrectly joined tables. However, the data is available with respect to 'riskfactorsystemname' that's why we were able to fetch data.



The core issue is that the tool used complex tables instead of simpler pandas data frames, leading to errors. I believe updating the BRD or making minor changes won’t significantly improve outcomes. Instead, unless we implement an additional layer to improve the tech specs, business analyst clarifies the document. The first agent should convert base BRD specs into precise technical specifications, enabling the model to better understand and refine them for a robust final version. 

We should also explicitly specify using pandas and avoid front-end tools for clarity.

For the next GMS iteration, I recommend not building on the existing system. Let’s take a step back, identify all solutions, and then start fresh. Let me know your thoughts or if there’s anything else to add.
